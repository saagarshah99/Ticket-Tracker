# Ticket Tracking System

<img src="./src/images/Ticket-Tracker-Screenshot.png" width="70%" />

This is a web app that allows you to track the number of project tickets different employees within a company have completed. You can also increase or decrease the number for each employee if the situation changes. This was a paired programming task completed alongside one of my colleagues on my _nology bootcamp.
